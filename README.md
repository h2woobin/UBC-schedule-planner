# My Personal Project: Test Guide

## Preparing the test application

Test Guide is a user-friendly application designed to help students manage and organize their test schedules and academic performance efficiently. User can add and remove their subjects and their detail. So, users can type the subject’s name, test day, test time, test location, cover chapters, and goal mark. A test **timetable** will be created if you put all subjects. The app provides flexibility, allowing users to modify or delete subjects as their plans or schedules change.

Once users do the test, they can enter their actual score into the application. The application will _calculate_ the user’s score (A+, A-…F) and give each grade. Also, it will calculate the user’s **total Grade Point Average (GPA)**. This feature helps students continuously monitor their academic performance.

As a student, exams are always following me since I was in Korea. In our country, KSAT is very serious for most students. Some student try suicide because of their bad result. There were a bunch of tests for every term. It's not easy to schedule the test every time. I always use paper notes to plan my tests and think like someone made a plan instead of me.
