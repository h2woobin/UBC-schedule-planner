# My Personal Project : Test Guide

## Preparing the test application

Test Guide is a user-friendly application designed to help students manage and organize their test schedules and academic performance efficiently. User can add and remove their subjects and their detail. So, users can type subject’s name, test day, test time, test location, cover chapters and goal mark. If you put all subjects, then test **timetable** will be created. The app provides flexibility, allowing users to modify or delete subjects as their plans or schedules change.

Once users done the test, they can enter their actual score into the application. The application will *calculate* user’s score (A+, A-…F) and give each of grade. Also, it will calculate use’s **total Grade Point Average (GPA)**. This feature helps students continuously monitor their academic performance.

As a student, exams are always following me since I was in Korea. In our country, KSAT is very serious for most of students. Some student try suicide because of their bad result. There were banch of tests for every term. It's not easy to schedule the test evey time. I alwasys use paper note to make a plan for my test and alsways thought like someone makea plan instead of me.
